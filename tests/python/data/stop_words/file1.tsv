LEICESTERSHIRE
TAKE
OVER
AT
TOP
AFTER
INNINGS
VICTORY
.

LONDON
1996-08-30

West
Indian
all-rounder
Phil
Simmons
took
four
for
38
on
Friday
as
Leicestershire
beat
Somerset
by
an
innings
and
39
runs
in
two
days
to
take
over
at
the
head
of
the
county
championship
.

Their
stay
on
top
,
though
,
may
be
short-lived
as
title
rivals
Essex
,
Derbyshire
and
Surrey
all
closed
in
on
victory
while
Kent
made
up
for
lost
time
in
their
rain-affected
match
against
Nottinghamshire
.

After
bowling
Somerset
out
for
83
on
the
opening
morning
at
Grace
Road
,
Leicestershire
extended
their
first
innings
by
94
runs
before
being
bowled
out
for
296
with
England
discard
Andy
Caddick
taking
three
for
83
.

Trailing
by
213
,
Somerset
got
a
solid
start
to
their
second
innings
before
Simmons
stepped
in
to
bundle
them
out
for
174
.

Essex
,
however
,
look
certain
to
regain
their
top
spot
after
Nasser
Hussain
and
Peter
Such
gave
them
a
firm
grip
on
their
match
against
Yorkshire
at
Headingley
.

Hussain
,
considered
surplus
to
England
's
one-day
requirements
,
struck
158
,
his
first
championship
century
of
the
season
,
as
Essex
reached
372
and
took
a
first
innings
lead
of
82
.

By
the
close
Yorkshire
had
turned
that
into
a
37-run
advantage
but
off-spinner
Such
had
scuttled
their
hopes
,
taking
four
for
24
in
48
balls
and
leaving
them
hanging
on
119
for
five
and
praying
for
rain
.

At
the
Oval
,
Surrey
captain
Chris
Lewis
,
another
man
dumped
by
England
,
continued
to
silence
his
critics
as
he
followed
his
four
for
45
on
Thursday
with
80
not
out
on
Friday
in
the
match
against
Warwickshire
.

He
was
well
backed
by
England
hopeful
Mark
Butcher
who
made
70
as
Surrey
closed
on
429
for
seven
,
a
lead
of
234
.

Derbyshire
kept
up
the
hunt
for
their
first
championship
title
since
1936
by
reducing
Worcestershire
to
133
for
five
in
their
second
innings
,
still
100
runs
away
from
avoiding
an
innings
defeat
.

Australian
Tom
Moody
took
six
for
82
but
Chris
Adams
,
123
,
and
Tim
O'Gorman
,
109
,
took
Derbyshire
to
471
and
a
first
innings
lead
of
233
.

After
the
frustration
of
seeing
the
opening
day
of
their
match
badly
affected
by
the
weather
,
Kent
stepped
up
a
gear
to
dismiss
Nottinghamshire
for
214
.

They
were
held
up
by
a
gritty
84
from
Paul
Johnson
but
ex-England
fast
bowler
Martin
McCague
took
four
for
55
.

By
stumps
Kent
had
reached
108
for
three
.

SHEARER
NAMED
AS
ENGLAND
CAPTAIN
.

LONDON
1996-08-30

The
world
's
costliest
footballer
Alan
Shearer
was
named
as
the
new
England
captain
on
Friday
.

The
26-year-old
,
who
joined
Newcastle
for
15
million
pounds
sterling
(
$
23.4
million
)
,
takes
over
from
Tony
Adams
,
who
led
the
side
during
the
European
championship
in
June
,
and
former
captain
David
Platt
.

Adams
and
Platt
are
both
injured
and
will
miss
England
's
opening
World
Cup
qualifier
against
Moldova
on
Sunday
.

Shearer
takes
the
captaincy
on
a
trial
basis
,
but
new
coach
Glenn
Hoddle
said
he
saw
no
reason
why
the
former
Blackburn
and
Southampton
skipper
should
not
make
the
post
his
own
.

"
I
'm
sure
there
wo
n't
be
a
problem
,
I
'm
sure
Alan
is
the
man
for
the
job
,
"
Hoddle
said
.

"
There
were
three
or
four
people
who
could
have
done
it
but
when
I
spoke
to
Alan
he
was
up
for
it
and
really
wanted
it
.

"
In
four
days
it
's
very
difficult
to
come
to
a
100
percent
conclusion
about
something
like
this
...

but
he
knows
how
to
conduct
himself
,
his
team
mates
respect
him
and
he
knows
about
the
team
situation
even
though
he
plays
up
front
.
"

Shearer
's
Euro
96
striking
partner
Teddy
Sheringham
withdrew
from
the
squad
with
an
injury
on
Friday
.

He
will
probably
be
replaced
by
Shearer
's
Newcastle
team
mate
Les
Ferdinand
.

VIOLENCE

MOSCOW
1996-08-30

Rotor
Volgograd
must
play
their
next
home
game
behind
closed
doors
after
fans
hurled
bottles
and
stones
at
Dynamo
Moscow
players
during
a
1-0
home
defeat
on
Saturday
that
ended
Rotor
's
brief
spell
as
league
leaders
.

The
head
of
the
Russian
league
's
disciplinary
committee
,
Anatoly
Gorokhovsky
,
said
on
Friday
that
Rotor
would
play
Lada
Togliatti
to
empty
stands
on
September
3
.

The
club
,
who
put
Manchester
United
out
of
last
year
's
UEFA
Cup
,
were
fined
$
1,000
.

Despite
the
defeat
,
Rotor
are
well
placed
with
11
games
to
play
in
the
championship
.

Lying
three
points
behind
Alania
and
two
behind
Dynamo
Moscow
,
the
Volgograd
side
have
a
game
in
hand
over
the
leaders
and

PANAMA
'S
ROBERTO
DURAN
FIGHTS
THE
SANDS
OF
TIME
.

PANAMA
CITY
1996-08-30

Panamanian
boxing
legend
Roberto
"
Hands
of
Stone
"
Duran
climbs
into
the
ring
on
Saturday
in
another
age-defying
attempt
to
sustain
his
long
career
.

Duran
,
45
,
takes
on
little-known
Mexican
Ariel
Cruz
,
30
,
in
a
super
middleweight
non-title
bout
in
Panama
City
.

The
fight
,
Duran
's
first
on
home
soil
for
10
years
,
is
being
billed
here
as
the
"
Return
of
the
Legend
"
and
Duran
still
talks
as
if
he
was
in
his
prime
.

"
I
want
a
fifth
title
.

This
match
is
to
prepare
me
.

I
feel
good
.

I
'm
not
retiring
,
"
Duran
told
Reuters
.

But
those
close
to
the
boxer
acknowledge
that
the
man
who
has
won
championships
in
four
different
weight
classes
--
lightweight
,
welterweight
,
junior
middleweight
and
middleweight
--
is
drawing
close
to
the
end
of
his
career
.

"
Each
time
he
fights
,
he
's
on
the
last
frontier
of
his
career
.

If
he
loses
Saturday
,
it
could
devalue
his
position
as
one
of
the
world
's
great
boxers
,
"
Panamanian
Boxing
Association
President
Ramon
Manzanares
said
.

Duran
,
whose
97-12
record
spans
three
decades
,
hopes
a
win
in
the
10-round
bout
will
earn
him
a
rematch
against
Puerto
Rico
's
Hector
"
Macho
"
Camacho
.

Camacho
took
a
controversial
points
decision
against
the
Panamanian
in
Atlantic
City
in

in

title
fight
