An

when

late
on
Friday
,
but
an
allegedly

driver
was

WASHINGTON

More
than
300
U.S.
warplanes
and
20
ships
were
available
on
Saturday
in
case
President
Bill
Clinton
ordered
the
use
of
U.S.
force
against
Iraqi
military
action
in
northern
Iraq
,
U.S.
defense
officials
said
.

They
said
200
fighter
planes
,
including
79
on
the
aircraft
carrier
Carl
Vinson
,
were
already
in
the
Gulf
;
the
aircraft
carrier
Enterprise
was
in
the
eastern
Mediterranean
with
79
more
,
and
an
air
expeditionary
force
with
up
to
40
more
was
ready
to
fly
from
the
United
States
if
ordered
.

"
Yesterday
the
president
ordered
the
Department
of
Defense
to
take
prudent
planning
steps
to
have
forces
ready
to
deploy
to
the
region
should
he
direct
us
to
do
so
,
"
Pentagon
spokesman
Doug
Kennett
said
.
"

We
have
taken
those
prudent
planning
steps
.
"

Clinton
said
on
Saturday
he
had
ordered
U.S.
forces
in
the
Gulf
to
go
on
high
alert
and
was
reinforcing
them
in
response
to
Iraqi
attacks
on
Kurdish
dissidents
in
northern
Iraq
.

"
These
developments
...
cause
me
grave
concern
,
"
Clinton
said
at
a
campaign
stop
in
Troy
,
Tennessee
.

But
he
added
,
"
It
is
premature
at
this
time
,
and
I
want
to
emphasize
that
,
highly
premature
to
speculate
on
any
response
we
might
have
.
"

The
U.S.
defense
officials
said
military
flights
to
enforce
no-fly
zones
in
both
northern
and
southern
Iraq
doubled
over
the
weekend
.

Clinton
said
Iraqi
military
forces
overran
the
city
of
Arbil
,
which
has
been
held
since
1994
by
Kurdish
rebels
who
Baghdad
says
are
backed
by
Iran
.

There
were
unconfirmed
reports
that
Iran
had
sent
troops
into
northern
Iraq
in
response
to
Iraq
's
attack
.

U.S.
plans
rely
heavily
on
U.S.
air
attacks
on
Iraqi
forces
,
but
there
are
also
23,000
U.S.
troops
in
the
region
,
according
to
defense
officials
.

In
addition
to
the
158
F
/
A-18
,
F-14
and
other
fighter
planes
on
the
aircraft
carriers
Vinson
and

the

Force
air
expeditionary
force
of
30
to
40
F-15
and
F-16
fighter
planes
and
fuel
tankers
is
ready
to
fly
from
three
U.S.
bases
in
the
United
States
,
they
said
.

The
expeditionary
force
would
include
nearly
1,000
Air
Force
personnel
in
ground
and
support
crews
,
they
said
.

The
23,000
U.S.
military
people
already
in
the
Gulf
consist
of
15,000
sailors
and
Marines
,
6,000
U.S.
servicemen
based
primarily
in

and

A

explosion
in
a
restaurant
west
of
Algiers
on
Friday
killed
seven
people
,
an
Algerian
newspaper
said
on

Algerian

in

that
two
people
were

and
six
were

when
a

bomb
ripped

But
Le
Matin
newspaper
,
quoting
witnesses
,
said
the
bomb
killed
seven
people
and
wounded
20
.

Liberte
newspaper
said
the
bomb
was
hidden
in
a
bag
in

of
the
restaurant
and
that
a
booby-trapped
car
was
defused
near
the
restaurant
shortly
before
the
bomb
went
off
.

A

a

in
the
western
coastal
town
of
Bou
Haroun
,
65
km
(
40
miles
)
from

Newspapers

it

two
women

Algerian

the

National
Observatory

,
a
government-appointed
watchdog
,
as
saying
earlier
in
August
that
about
1,400
civilians
had
been
killed
in
bomb
attacks
blamed
on
Moslem
guerrillas
in
the
past

An

50,000
people
have
died
in
Algeria
's
violence
pitting
Moslem
rebels
against
government
forces
since
early
1992

Iranian
security
forces
burst
into
the
home
of
a
German
cultural
attache
in
Tehran
a
month
ago
and
seized
his
guests
for
questioning
,
Bonn
's
foreign
ministry
said
on

A
spokesman
said
he
could
substantially
confirm

report
in

,
which
said
Iranian
secret

burst
in

on
suspicion
of
"
promoting
activities
hostile
to

"
while
his
guests
were
taken
away
,
the

The

spokesman
said
the

embassy
immediately
made
a
sharp

to
the
Tehran
government
.

The
Iranian
ambassador
was
also
summoned
to
the

to
hear
a
sharp
protest
and
"
disapproval
of
this
glaring
breach
of
the
principles
of
international
law
"
,
he
added
.

Iran
subsequently
said
it
regretted
the
incident
,
which
it
said
had
been
the
result
of
a
misunderstanding
.

All
those
detained
appeared
to
have
been
freed
,
the
spokesman
said
.

Relations
between
the
two
countries
are
currently
under
strain
because
of
the
testimony
in
a
Berlin
court
of
former
Iranian
president
Abolhassan
Banisadr
.

Banisadr
,
an
avowed
opponent
of
the
Tehran
government
who
now
lives
in
exile
,
accused
top
Iranian
leaders
of
personally
ordering
the
assassination
of
three
exiled
Kurdish
leaders
in
a
Berlin
restaurant
in
1992
.

Iran
has
asked
Germany
to
extradite
Banisadr
,
who
is
due
is
due
back
in
Berlin
next
Thursday
to
continue
his
testimony
.

Banisadr
,
who
received
political
asylum
in
France
after
fleeing
there
in
1981
,
told
Der
Spiegel
he
did
not
plan
to
ask
for
a
guarantee
of
safe
conduct
.

If
Germany
were
to
extradite
him
,
he
said
,
it
would
"
lose
face
before
the
whole
world
"
.

German
prosecutors
have
already
accused
Iran
's
intelligence
minister
Ali
Fallahiyan
of
ordering
the
killing
of
the
Kurdish
leaders
.

Iran
,
which
denies
the
allegations

urged
German

testimony
and
said
it

hurt

Controversial
IRA
film
screened
at
Venice
festival
.

Vera
Haller

VENICE
,
Italy
1996-08-31

Dublin-born
director
Neil
Jordan
says
he
never
lost
more
sleep
over
a
film
than
over
"
Michael
Collins
"
,
his
controversial
epic
about
the
IRA
which
has
its
premiere
on
Saturday
at
the
Venice
Film
Festival
.

The
film
,
starring
Liam
Neeson
and
Julia
Roberts
,
recounts
the
life
of
Michael
Collins
,
the
Irish
Republican
Army
's
Director
of
Intelligence
who
fought
for
Irish
independence
from
1919
to
1921
.

Although
not
due
for
release
in
Britain
until
early
next
year
,
some
politicians
have
already
said
they
feared
it
would
fan
sectarian
tensions
in
British-ruled
Northern
Ireland
.

Jordan
defends
his
decision
to
make
the
film
,
whose
screenplay
he
wrote
himself
after
years
of
research
,
saying
it
was
"
more
about
history
than
any
political
statement
"
.

"
The
film
spares
neither
the
Irish
nor
the
British
in
its
depiction
of
the
savagery
of
the
time
,
"
Jordan
said
in
a
statement
released
by
Warner
Bros
.
"

How
often
has
independence
been
achieved
without
bloodshed
?

Very
rarely
.
"

Jordan
,
whose
1992
film
"
The
Crying
Game
"
also
came
under
fire
for
what
was
perceived
as
a
sympathetic
portrayal
of
the
IRA
,
said
Collins
was
more
than
just
a
revolutionary
.

"
He
developed
techniques
of
guerilla
warfare
later
copied
by
independence
movements
around
the
world
,
from
Mao
Tse-Tung
in
China
to
Yitzak
Shamir
in
Israel
,
"
Jordan
said
.

"
Collins
would
never
be
a
proponent
of
contemporary
terrorism
as
practised
today
.

He
was
a
soldier
and
a
statesman
and
,
over
time
,
a
man
of
peace
.
"

Leeson
,
the
Northern
Ireland-born
actor
who
was
nominated
for
an
Oscar
for
best
actor
for
his
performance
in
"
Schindler
's
List
"
,
plays
the
lead
role
in
Jordan
's
film
.

Aidan
Quinn
portrays
Harry
Boland
,
Collins
'
best
friend
,
and
rival
for
the
love
of
Kitty
Kiernan
,
played
by
Roberts
.

Much
of
the
film
was
shot
on
location
in
Dublin
with
Jordan
using
thousands
of
its
citizens
as
unpaid
extras
.

A
set
,
however
,
was
used
for
the
fighting
scenes
.

Noting
that
information
about
Collins
was
"
as
mysterious
as
the
existence
he
maintained
"
,
Jordan
said
he
made
some
historical
assumptions
in
the
film
.

"
I
have
made
choices
about
certain
events
based
on
my
own
extensive
research
into
his
letters
and
reported
speeches
,
"
he
said
.
"

I
wanted
to
make
this
a
story
as
accurate
as
possible
without
killing
it
dramatically
and
I
think
